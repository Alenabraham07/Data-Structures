Given an array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum, write a function that find all combinations of three numbers in the array
that add up to the target sum. The function should return a 2-dimensional array of all these combinations. The numbers in each combination should be ordered 
in ascending order, and the combinations themselves should also be ordered in ascending order, for instance: [[-8, 2, 6],[-8, 3, 5], [-6, 1, 5]]. 
If there is no such combination, return an empty array.
