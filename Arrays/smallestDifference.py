# Given two arrays of integers, I am asked to write a function that finds two numbers, where one number comes from the first array and another number comes 
# from the second array, with smallest absolute difference, and returns them in an array. 
# In the resulting array, the number from the first array should come first.

# For example,
# arrayOne = [-1, 5, 10, 20, 28, 3];
# arrayTwo = [26, 134, 135, 15, 17];

# The output is [28, 26].
