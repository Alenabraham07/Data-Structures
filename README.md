# DSA using Python

<p>I have started learning Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA) and I will upload the problems I solve to this repo to evaluate my progress. I will be solving problems in python. I will be taking questions from Algoexpert, Leetcode and various other platforms. I will mention the platform names and embed the corresponding problems in that file.</p>

_Anyone can make commit to this repo and add more efficient codes._
